# rc-prjkt-client

RC Prjkt is an application used to showcase the projects you're working on at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)!

Projects have tags which allow Recursers to filter projects by their interests and find opportunities to pair, receive a code review, and more!

## Front-End

The front-end is built with React, TypeScript, and React Query.
